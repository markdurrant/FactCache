# fact cache

## what is it…
A place to share diamonds found whilst mining open data.

During hackathons developers often find really interesting little factoids but they often get forgotten in the rush to create nifty applications. Fact cache displays these little nuggets of awesome for everyone to see & share.

## how does it…
It does it on the front-end with Sass & Compass for styling and jQuery & Chart.js (cobbled together) for everything else. currently using hard-coded dummy data, because the author is  allergic to servers.


## what's a fact…
There are 3 types of 'fact' in fact cache.
* Text facts
* Image facts
* Graph facts

Each fact contains.
* a title 
* links to data sources that the fact came from
* link to the project the fact was discovered with
* names/link for author(s)
* button to tweet this fact

A graph fact also contains a graph (created with charts.js) and an image fact also contains an image. A text fact contains styles to highlight the title.

## who did it… 
Mark Durrant as part of the @rewiredstate Follow the data London hackathon on the 5th of May 2013.
